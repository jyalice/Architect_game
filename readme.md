##The design of this game was inspired by a more complicated Tik Tok game.

##The goal in this game is to build your city to an as high as possible level.

##In the beginning, all areas are filled with raw materials (trees or stones).

##Upgrade them by clicking. A clicked area will integrate raw materials of the same type in neighboring areas, so the clicked area will be upgraded, and the neighboring areas will become empty. 

##Materials in upper areas will fall into lower areas and new materials will be produced to fill upper areas if they are empty.

##Finally areas are upgraded so much that you will have a city of level one. The wave-shaped word in the background will claim the city level to celebrate your achievement.

##You may go on upgrading your city to a higher level. Among the randomly produced materials there will be a new type (ore).

##Enjoy building your city in this interesting game!
